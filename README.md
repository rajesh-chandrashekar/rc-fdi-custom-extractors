## Features

**Custom Extractor SDK** simplifies the development of data extractors that connect, query, and extract data from diverse sources into Oracle Fusion Data Intelligence.  
Key capabilities include:

- Ready-to-use Maven project scaffolding for rapid setup.
- Support for custom data connection, authentication, and query logic.
- Seamless integration with the Extract Service in FDI.
- CLI tools for deploying and managing custom extractors in Remote Agent environments.
- Sample extractors and templates for common data sources.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Oracle Fusion Data Intelligence Account**  
   Access to FDI environment and Remote Agent.

2. **Java & Maven**  
   Ensure Java 11+ and Apache Maven are installed and configured.

3. **SDK Package**  
   Obtain the SDK ZIP archive from Oracle distribution.

---

## Installation

1. Unzip the SDK archive:

    ```bash
    unzip fdi-extractor-sdk-26.5.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
    ```

2. Review the SDK contents:

    ```text
    install.sh
    lib/
    ```

3. Install the SDK:

    ```bash
    sh install.sh
    ```

## Quick Start

### Generate a New Custom Extractor Project

Use Maven to scaffold a new extractor project:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate    -DarchetypeCatalog=internal    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.oracle.faw.extractservice    -DarchetypeArtifactId=extractservice-archetype    -DarchetypeVersion=24.5.0-SNAPSHOT    -DgroupId=oracle.apps.bi.extractservice.extract.impl    -DartifactId=customextract    -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Project Structure

```text

└── src
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   │   └── oracle
    │   │       └── apps

        │                           └── ExtractorTest.java
        └── resources
            └── extractor_test.properties
```

---

## Building

Compile the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This generates a JAR file in the `target` directory:

```
customextract-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

## Deployment

1. Copy the generated JAR to the Remote Agent directory:

    ```bash
    cp target/customextract-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /faw/software/custom-extractors/drivers-jar/
    ```

2. Restart the Remote Agent Docker container:

    ```bash
    sudo docker restart <remoteagent-container-name>
    # Example
    sudo docker restart remoteagent
    ```

---

## Testing

Update the `extractor_test.properties` file with your environment settings and run `ExtractorTest` to validate the extractor implementation.

### Test Coverage

- `getSourceType()`  
- `verifyConnection()`  
- `extractDataStores()`  
- `queryData()`  

### Example Reference

Use the provided **COVID Extractor Sample** as a reference implementation for testing and configuration. Modify it to match your data source and logic.

---

## Samples

Sample extractors are available under the [`samples`](./samples) directory. These can be used as templates for building new extractors or extended for different data sources.

Current samples include:

- [`samples/covid-data-extractor`](./samples/covid-data-extractor): sample custom extractor implementation
- [`samples/tcf-data-extractor`](./samples/tcf-data-extractor): sample TCF reader and pipeline implementation for processing FDI Table Change Format data
